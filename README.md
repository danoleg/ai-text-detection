# ai-text-detection

This application was created to check if the text was generated by artificial intelligence or written by a human.

To develop this application, a data set of 35,000 texts written by people and ChatGPT was used, which were converted into 20 numerical values, that describe the characteristics of each of them.

The following model configuration was used to generate texts in ChatGpt

```
model="text-curie-001"
prompt=prompt
temperature=0.7
max_tokens=300
top_p=1
frequency_penalty=0.4
presence_penalty=0.1
```

To try the application you can use [online demo](http://185.69.153.16:8010/text-processing) or run it locally with your own Cloud SQL account.

### How to run app:
1) Build app
```
> docker-compose up --build
```

And open http://127.0.0.1:8010/

1) Open your Cloud Service Portal and create the new Deployment
2) Go to the app and set your deployment credentials
